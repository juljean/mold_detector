    "Acremonium":
        "Acremonium: \n\n "
        "Acremonium cause human superficial infections including mycetoma,"
        " onychomycosis and keratitis. Human infections due to fungi belonging to the genus Acremonium occur uncommonly,"
        " but unlike infections due to other filamentous fungi, usually affect immunocompetent individuals.\n\n"
        "Optimal treatment of acremonium infections is not well defined both because infections due to these organisms are rare,"
        " and because many reports antedate effective antifungal therapy.\n\n"
        "Remove and discard all loose infected items such as carpet, drapes and furniture. Use a non-toxic, "
        "registered fungicide to kill Acremonium on structural areas or other materials"
        " that can't be easily removed and thrown away.",

    "Alternaria":
        "Alternaria \n\n"
        "Exposure to the fungus Alternaria alternata is an important risk factor for asthma and allergic rhinitis.\n\n"
        "Liquid copper fungicides such as Monterey Liqui-Cop or Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide are extremely effective for the control of many fungal diseases including alternaria.\n\n"
        "Chlorine bleach: Sodium hypochlorite or regular household bleach works best to destroy alternaria mold.",


    "Aspergillus":
        "Aspergillus\n\n"
        "Exposure to Aspergillus is not likely to cause problems in the majority of people whose immune systems are healthy. However, people with chronic lung problems or people with weak immune systems may be at greater risk for developing the infection. It is estimated that up to 10% of people with cystic fibrosis or asthma experience an allergic reaction to aspergillus. \n\n" \
        "Treatment options include oral corticosteroids, antifungal medications, and surgery.\n\n" 
        "Use a non-toxic registered fungicide to kill the mold, being careful not to disturb the area so you don't release fresh spores. For any possible Aspergillus mold growth larger than a few feet across, it's best to call in mold removal professionals.",


    "Cladosporium":
        "Cladosporium\n\n"
        "Cladosporium is a common mold that may affect your health. It can cause allergies and asthma in some people. In very rare cases, it can cause infections. Most species of Cladosporium aren’t dangerous to humans.\n\n" \
        "There are many medications that a doctor can recommend or prescribe to a person with a Cladosporium allergy. These medications may include a combination of the following: nasal sprays; antihistamines; oral or nasal decongestants\n\n" \
        "Open some windows or install a heat recovery ventilator (HRV). These measures will help stop new mold from forming, but won't kill active Cladosporium spores already there. For that you'll need a non-toxic registered fungicide such as Concrobium. A small area of mold can be treated with a vinegar solution or bleach.",


    "Fusarium":
        "Fusarium\n\n"
        "Fusarium species cause a broad spectrum of infections including superficial infections such as keratitis and onychomycosis, as well as locally invasive and disseminated infections. Fusarium species can cause mycotoxicosis in humans following ingestion of food that has been colonized by the fungal organism.\n\n" \
        "Treatment of persons who have suffered chronic or acute mold and mycotoxin exposure with possible mold toxicity can include oxygen therapy, immunotherapy, detoxification therapy, nutrient therapy, and immune therapy directed at improving and regulating the immune system.\n\n" \
        "There is no effective fungicide or other cure for Fusarium.",


    "Mucor":
        "Mucor\n\n"
        "These fungi aren't harmful to most people. However, for people who have weakened immune systems, breathing in mucormycete spores can cause an infection in the lungs or sinuses which can spread to other parts of the body. Mucormycosis (previously called zygomycosis) is a serious but rare fungal infection.\n\n"
        "Mucormycosis needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medicine, usually amphotericin B, posaconazole, or isavuconazole.\n\n"
        "If you chose to remove the mold yourself, make sure to wear the proper gear, including disposable gloves and a mold protective face mask. Block the work area so mold spores can’t drift into clean areas, and dispose of contaminated materials by sealing them in heavy plastic bags before you carry them out.",


    "Penicillium":
        "Penicillium\n\n"
        "Penicillium species are among the most common fungi present in the environment and are usually considered non-pathogenic to humans. However, in immunocompromised hosts they can be virulent pathogens and can cause death.\n\n"
        "The most common treatment is amphotericin B, given through a vein for two weeks, followed by itraconazole, given by mouth for 10 weeks.\n\n"
        "To prevent Penicillium spreading, make sure your home is dry and well ventilated. Don't keep spoiling food of any sort, because it's a perfect environment for spores to take root. If you find a small amount of mold, soak it thoroughly with a non-toxic registered fungicide.",

    "Rhizopus":
        "Rhizopus\n\n"
        "Rhizopus can cause localized and disseminated mucormycosis. Sinusitis and pneumonia are the most common types of infection with dissemination prevalent in patients with underlying disease. Inhalation of spores, in addition to traumatic implantation, can cause disease.\n\n"
        "First-line treatment with high-dose liposomal amphotericin B is strongly recommended, followed by intravenous isavuconazole and intravenous or delayed-release tablet posaconazole.\n\n"
        "The fungus cannot grow or germinate spores at temperatures below 5°C. However, if infection is present, the disease can progress rapidly once you take your stone fruit out of refrigeration and subject them to warmer temperatures.",

    "Stachybotrys":
        "Stachybotrys\n\n"
        "Commonly reported symptoms of stachybotrys infection of respiratory tract include nasal irritation, burning and congestion, cough, wheezing, chest tightness and dyspnea.\n\n"
        "Since stachybotrys is only able to grow on porous surfaces like wood and drywall there is no way to simply wipe away this species of mold. Any time toxic black mold is present the building materials that have been contaminated must be discarded or at the very least treated by a professional.",


    "Trichoderma":
        "Trichoderma\n\n"
        "Trichoderma may cause (rhino)sinusitis; otitis externa; lung, central nervous system (CNS), liver, and skin infections; stomatitis; peritonitis; endocarditis; onychomycosis; keratitis; and disseminated infections.\n\n"
        "Trichoderma is tough to get rid of once it starts growing. It's resistant to most chemicals and pesticides.",


    "Trichophyton":
        "Trichophyton\n\n"
        "Trichophyton usually causes a superficial skin infection, affecting the outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum. In immunocompromised patients, deeper invasion into the dermis and even severe systemic infection with distant organ involvement can occur.\n\n"
        "They can be transmitted by direct contact, by contact with infested particles (of dead skin, nails, hair) shed by the host, and by contact with the fungi's spores.",
